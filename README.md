# Melon Green
### Greenhouse, Farm & Garden Automation Project
To assist plant lovers & hobby gardeners, as well as greenhouse or garden keepers, Melon Green project is an open-source farm, garden and greenhouse automation system (hardware & software), which is aimed to be easy to use, affordable and multi-purpose tool.    


### How does it work?
In summary, Melon Green is a [board](Documentation/1_Melon_Green_Board_[DIY].md) (based on AVR microprocessors) with an [operating software](Documentation/2_Upload_Melon_Green_to_AVR.md), which gets [your orders (settings)](Documentation/3_Serial_Command_Line_Interface.md), detects events in its environment, and toggles agricultural machinery (like irrigation pumps, solenoid valves, heaters, fogger etc.) on or off, when it's needed.  
Melon Green senses Date & Time, Temperature, Humidity, Soil Moisture, Rain & Sun Light Intensity. It can operate irrigation system/facilities, grow light supplier, heater, fan/cooler and fogger. Melon Green has also some experimental functionalities to mix feeding solution (diluting liquid fertilizer).
